# Conditional Gaussian (Multivariate Normal) Calculator 📱🧮💹📉📈
This is executible tool build by python to calculate Conditional Guassian's Mean & Variance(MSE), Intercept & Coefficients.
This project is built based on the theory discussed in [Theory_Conditional_Normal.ipynb](Theory_Conditional_Normal.ipynb). Click the link to view the notebook.
